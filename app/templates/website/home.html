        <p> Hello everyone, it has been more than an year and a half since I blogged. Ever since I started working on Google Summer of Code 2009 for Melange project I haven't really got any time to make blog posts. I would like to do but the time has been very restrictive to me since then, with most of my time devoted to FOSSEE, Melange among other things. This is only a special blog post. Our paper titled "Optimal Streaming Protocol for Video-on-Demand using Clientâ€™s Residual Bandwidth" was chosen as Top 10 Research papers in India by HP Labs under the program HP Innovate 2008. We have recently noticed that HP Labs has removed the HP Innovate 2008 website. This, for us, means that there is no record of our paper being chosen as top 10 research papers in India for the year 2008 by HP Labs. Unfortunately we are helpless about it since HP Labs had already informed us that it holds the right to do so. So in order to keep a record of it, I have put the URL at which HP had published our paper. This is because, if at all HP brings back the site up on our request (about which we will be writing to HP Labs soon) we have the reference back. </p>
